# Spotify Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

This is the second video of my quarantine react js learning. This is also part of my learn js/reactjs through developing mini apps. This build in particular was done by following CleverProgrammer's (Build a Spotify Clone with REACT JS)[https://youtu.be/pnkuI8KXW_8] Youtube video.

They have other videos such as an Amazon clone, Tiktok clone, WhatsApp clone etc. Good for beginners who want to learn reactjs by example.

My first build (Tinder) can be found (here)[https://github.com/mikeejazmines/tinder-clone]

Aside from ReactJS, this also connects to firebase and spotify api.
